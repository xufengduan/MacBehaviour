\usage{
loadData(runList, itemIDList, conditionList, promptList, header = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{runList}{A numeric vector of data representing the 'Run' column in the experiment.}

\item{itemIDList}{A numeric vector of data representing the 'itemID' column in the experiment.}

\item{conditionList}{A numeric/character vector of data representing the 'Condition' column in the experiment.}

\item{promptList}{A character vector of the main prompt (usually experiment items).}

\item{header}{A logical value indicating if the output data.frame should include column headers (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the processed columns 'Run', 'Trial', 'Item', 'Condition', and 'Prompt', ready for use in experiments.
}
\description{
Prepares the stimuli data for the experiment.
